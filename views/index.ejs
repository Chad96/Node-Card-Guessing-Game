            <h2>How to Play 🕹:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal the letters on their back sides.</li>
                <li>If the letters on the two flipped cards match, those cards will remain face up, indicating they have been successfully matched.</li>
                <li>If the letters do not match, the cards will flip back over to their face-down position after a short delay.</li>
                <li>Continue flipping pairs of cards until all matching pairs have been found.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Rules 🚀:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Only two cards can be flipped at a time.</li>
                <li>If two flipped cards do not match, they will be flipped back over after 1 second.</li>
                <li>The game ends when all pairs have been successfully matched.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Tips 💡:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to remember the positions and letters of previously flipped cards to find matches more efficiently.</li>
                <li>Start by flipping over different pairs each time to gain more information about the card positions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Winning the Game 🥇:</h2>
            <p>You win the game when you have successfully matched all pairs of cards, and all cards are face up.</p>
            <p>Enjoy playing the memory game and challenge yourself to complete it as quickly as possible!</p>
